## iris-nativeapi-python-example

Python code from the article [IRIS Native API for Python](https://community.intersystems.com/post/iris-native-api-python).

To run the examples successfully, download the [San Francisco GTFS files](https://transitfeeds.com/p/sfmta/60)
and place the .txt files in the directory of the examples. (Only tested with the GTFS files of 10 June 2019.)

Run `store.py` to store the GTFS data into the global. Run `query*.py` to run the
querying examples from the article.
